### In order to run the bot locally Follow the instructions given below:
#### Create a Discord Bot
To create a Discord Bot, you must:
* have a [Discord Account](https://discord.com/login)
* have a Discord server for the bot
* create a Discord bot in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), but DO NOT ADD to your server yet ([Follow instructions here](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/))
* create a `.env` file with your Bot Token and add this to your .gitignore (Discord will automatically regenerate your token if you accidentally upload it to Github).<br/> NOTE: You dont need to include { } in the .env file.<br/>
    ```
    # .env
    DISCORD_TOKEN={your-bot-token}
    DICORD_BOT_NAME={your-bot-name}
    TEST_GUILD_ID={your-guild-id}
    TESTING_BOT_TOKEN={test-bot-token}
    TEST_BOT_NAME={test-bot-name}
    TEST_BOT_APP_ID={test-bot-application-id}
    VERSION={custom bot version}
    ```

NOTE: Run the bot before inviting it to your server in order for auto-initiate commands to run

This includes the following:
* Creating Instructor Role
* Adding server owner to Instructor Role
* Creating Bot channels
