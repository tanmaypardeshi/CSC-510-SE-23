<h2>Software Engineering Project for CSC 510 : Phase III</h2>


Teacher's Pet is a Discord Bot for class instructors to streamline their Discord servers. Discord is a great tool for communication and its functionalities can be enhanced by bots and integrations. 

For 3.0, we created new tools for instructors and students to use to improve course communication. Some of our implemented features were partly suggested by iteration 2 such as regrade requests, project event, and live spam checking. We implemented other features we thought would be helpful such as email interactions, link saving, and data visualization. Our main objective for 3.0 was to add more organizational tools to make a course's discord channel more than just a messenger.

<h2>Bot Features</h2>

[Click here to see the features of iterations I and II.](https://github.com/chandur626/TeachersPetBot/blob/update-readme/docs/feature-history.md)

<h4>Charts</h4>
Instructors (like TAs, and Professors) can quickly make graphcs and charts directly in discord to share with students/users. Instructors can use this feature to share grade distributions, lecture participation/attendance, or other course statistics. All charts are named and stored into a json file when they are created. Students have acess to a command that allows them to view previously presented charts.

<h4>Email Configuration</h4>

This feature enables users to configure their email address in the system to receive important notifications, attachments from professors, assignment reminders. Users can also update, view and unconfigure a configured email address through the system.

<h4>Re-Grading</h4>

This feature provides a way for students to submit regrade requests and Instructors can collect information of the requests submitted. There are various commands included to add, update, display and remove regrade requests.
This usecase was based on regrade request submission for CSE 510 SE FALL21 mid examination.

<h4>Link Saving</h4>

This feature is helpful to save all the messages which contain important URLs. we have built a user command "!send_links"  This command lets users access all messages which contain URLs. The messages Containing URLs are automatically get appended in a file and the file is attached when the "!send_links" command is input.

<h4>Project Event</h4>

This feature allows instructors or teaching assistants to create a project event by providing information such as description, link for project submission and deadline. The deadline reminder is taken care of Email Interaction feature.

<h4>Spam Detection</h4>
This feature is used to detect spam in message channels. When a user tries to send too many messages in the channel, it gives a warning. This is useful when multiple users are trying to send mutiple messages. The warning lets the student know that they have sent too many messages.
